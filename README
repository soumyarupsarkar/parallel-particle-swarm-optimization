An (incomplete) particle swarm optimization library with minimal
dependencies.

See ./demo/demo.cpp to see how to use it, and ./docs/report.pdf for an
explanation of the algorithm (based on a paper by Chang et al: "A
Guaranteed Global Convergence Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
with Communication Strategies").

This was part of a final project for an optimization course, and it is
not meant to be used in practice; use PSwarm instead:
